# steelsofliquid_miniprojects
This repo contains the source code for all of my miscellaneous side-projects that I wrote intentionally. This includes code for Python, C++, etc. and may vary widely, but expect to find a lot of sample projects I wrote to test my skills and keep them sharp.

To see my thoughts and whatnot on the current situation of the project, check out my log repo, https://github.com/steelsofliquid/steelsofliqud_log. *This repo also contains my thoughts and whatnot on my other projects.
